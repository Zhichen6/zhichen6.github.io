<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

We bring together human-centered AI, game theory, and data-driven optimization to develop next-generation modeling and computational tools for mobility and logistics systems, with a focus on connectivity, electrification, and automation. Our research directions include, but are not limited to:

- **AI-enabled modeling and optimization of complex transportation networks**
- **Economic modeling and regulation in multimodal transportation and the sharing economy**
- **Learning, adaptation and regulation in human-autonomous-vehicle interaction**


🎓 **Multiple PhD Student Opportunities (Spring/Fall 2026)**  
We are currently recruiting 2–3 PhD students for Spring or Fall 2026. Find out more about the opportunity and how to apply [here](/opening/).

🤝 **Partnerships**  
We welcome collaborations across academia, industry, and government to advance next-generation mobility systems. Whether you're looking to collaborate or connect for mentorship, we’d love to hear from you.
