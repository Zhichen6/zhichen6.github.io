üóìÔ∏è **Next Priority Deadline:** October 1, 2025  
üí∞ **Funding:** 4‚Äì5 years of funding (includes a competitive stipend and full tuition waiver)


### Qualifications

- Hold or pursue a Bachelor‚Äôs or Master‚Äôs degree in Civil Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, or a related field.  
- Proficiency in programming and computational tools is preferred.
- Strong background and interest in operations research (convex/nonconvex/stochastic optimization), machine learning (deep/reinforcement learning), game theory, or mechanism design is preferred.  

PhD positions include 4‚Äì5 years of research funding (a very competitive stipend plus tuition waiver). 

### Application Process

For the best use of your time and mine, please follow the steps below when applying:

1.	If you are interested, please send an email to Zhichen.Liu@stonybrook.edu with the subject line "Prospective Student - YOURNAME" including your CV and transcript. Depending on your visa status, you may begin in Spring 2026 or Fall 2026. 

2.	If you appear to be a potential fit, I will reach out to schedule a 30-minute screening interview. This will be an informal conversation for us to get to know each other and discuss your interests and goals.

3.	If we both feel there is strong alignment, I will invite you for a formal one-hour interview focused on research design and behavioral questions

### Please Note:

- For students who have reached out, I carefully read every application and truly appreciate the time and effort you put into preparing your materials. Due to the large number of applications, only shortlisted candidates will be contacted for the next steps. I apologize for not being able to reply to everyone individually.

- Admission is on a rolling basis. If this information is still posted here, the application is still open.

- Our department has openings for the GAANN fellowship program. The prospective student can choose any Civil Engineering faculty member to be their academic advisor. Contact me if you are interested and eligible to apply.

# üî¨ Research


Our lab focuses on innovating next-generation modeling and computational tools for mobility and logistics systems, with a emphasis on connectivity, electrification, and automation. Our core research directions include, but are not limited to:


### 1. AI-Enabled Modeling and Optimization of Transportation Networks

By 2035, nearly half of all new vehicles in the United States will be connected, generating unprecedented volumes of mobility data. We are developing an AI-enabled inverse learning framework that leverages advances in machine learning and corwdsourced mobility data to transform the foundational paradigm of transportation network equilibrium modeling ‚Äî a pillar of transportation system planning and management for over seventy years.


### 2. Economic Modeling and Regulation in Multimodal Transportation and the Sharing Economy


Ridesourcing vehicles generate nearly three times the vehicle miles traveled compared to private vehicles and are destined to be the next special fleet for electrification. However, high purchase costs and limited access to fast charging remain major barriers. This direction develop a novel aggregate equilibrium model for the electrified ridesourcing system and design innovative (i) regulatory policies and (ii) differential matching mechanisms to accelerate the electrification.


### 3. Learning, Adaptation, and Policy Design in Human‚ÄìAutonomous Vehicle Interactions

By 2045, half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be autonomous. As humans and AVs increasingly share the road, complex interaction dynamics will emerge. While some believe AVs will enhance safety, others raise concerns that AVs‚Äô strict adherence to traffic laws may provoke aggressive behaviors ‚Äî for instance, pedestrians intentionally running red lights ‚Äî potentially destabilizing traffic flow. This research seeks to model and inform the co-adaptation of humans and autonomous systems. Our goal is to support policymakers in designing behavioral and regulatory strategies that improve safety, reduce congestion and emissions, and facilitate broader AV adoption.
