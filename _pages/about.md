<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering (Next Generation Transportation) at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Prof.Yafeng Yin](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/yin-yafeng/), with a master in Industrial and Operation Engineering. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering from Southeast University, China, in 2020.

My research focuses on bring together machine learning theory, game theory, and optimization to transforming game-theoretical modeling and decision-making in transportation systems. My research interest focus on:
- **AI-enabled analysis and management of urban transportation networks**
- **Sustainable shared mobility modeling and policy**
- **Human-autonomous vehicle interaction and regulation**

I am honored to have received the Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship and a nomination for the College of Engineering's Towner Prize for Outstanding GSIs. **I am currently seeking an assistant professor position in transportation engineering and industrial engineering**.
