Our research lab focuses on innovating next-generation modeling and computational tools for mobility and logistics systems, with a emphasis on connectivity, electrification, and automation. Our core research directions include, but are not limited to:

---

### 1. AI-Enabled Modeling and Optimization of Transportation Networks

By 2035, nearly half of all new vehicles in the United States will be connected, generating unprecedented volumes of mobility data. We are developing an AI-enabled inverse learning framework that leverages advances in machine learning and corwdsourced mobility data to transform the foundational paradigm of transportation network equilibrium modeling â€” a pillar of transportation system planning and management for over seventy years.

### 2. Economic Modeling and Regulation in Multimodal Transportation and the Sharing Economy


Ridesourcing vehicles generate nearly three times the vehicle miles traveled compared to private vehicles and are destined to be the next special fleet for electrification. However, high purchase costs and limited access to fast charging remain major barriers. This direction develop a novel aggregate equilibrium model for the electrified ridesourcing system and design innovative (i) regulatory policies and (ii) differential matching mechanisms to accelerate the electrification.

### 3. Learning, Adaptation, and Policy Design in Humanâ€“Autonomous Vehicle Interactions

By 2045, half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are expected to be autonomous. As humans and AVs increasingly share the road, complex interaction dynamics will emerge. While some believe AVs will enhance safety, others raise concerns that AVsâ€™ strict adherence to traffic laws may provoke aggressive behaviors â€” for instance, pedestrians intentionally running red lights â€” potentially destabilizing traffic flow. This research seeks to model and inform the co-adaptation of humans and autonomous systems. Our goal is to support policymakers in designing behavioral and regulatory strategies that improve safety, reduce congestion and emissions, and facilitate broader AV adoption.
